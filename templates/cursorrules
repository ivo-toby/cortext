# Cortext Workspace AI Rules

## Project Context
This is a Cortext workspace for AI-augmented knowledge work.

## Workspace Structure
- `.workspace/memory/constitution.md`: User's working principles and preferences
- `conversations/`: All AI conversations organized by date (YYYY-MM/###-type-topic/)
- `research/`: Formal research projects
- `ideas/`: Unstructured ideation
- `notes/`: Learning notes and references
- `projects/`: Active project workspaces
- `.workspace/registry.json`: Conversation type registry

## Key Principles

### 1. Read the Constitution First
Before starting any work, read `.workspace/memory/constitution.md` to understand:
- The user's communication preferences
- Working principles and methodology
- Technical preferences and guardrails
- Current context and focus areas

### 2. Maintain Structured Documentation
- Use existing conversation templates
- Keep consistent formatting
- Add proper metadata (date, type, tags)
- Cross-reference related conversations when relevant

### 3. Git Workflow
- Each conversation lives on its own branch (`conversation/###-type-topic`)
- Commit atomically with structured messages
- Use conventional commit types: `[conversation]`, `[research]`, `[decision]`, `[note]`
- Reference related conversations in commits

### 4. Conversation Types
Use appropriate conversation templates:
- **Brainstorm**: Free-form ideation and exploration
- **Debug**: Systematic problem-solving
- **Plan**: Feature and project planning
- **Learn**: Learning notes and documentation
- **Meeting**: Meeting notes with action items
- **Review**: Code and design reviews

### 5. Search Past Work
Before answering questions or making suggestions:
- Check if similar conversations exist
- Look for relevant decisions in `.workspace/memory/decisions.md`
- Cross-reference related topics
- Build on past insights

## When Creating Content

### Structure
- Use markdown formatting consistently
- Include clear headers and sections
- Add code blocks with syntax highlighting
- Use checklists for actionable items

### Metadata
Always include:
- Date and timestamp
- Conversation type
- Status (In Progress, Completed, etc.)
- Tags for searchability

### Cross-References
Link to related work:
- Reference conversation IDs
- Link to decision logs
- Note dependencies

## Conversation Flow

### Starting a Conversation
1. Check current context (`.workspace/memory/context.md`)
2. Identify appropriate conversation type
3. Use the template structure
4. Fill in metadata

### During a Conversation
- Stay focused on the conversation type's goals
- Document key insights and decisions
- Track action items with checkboxes
- Note open questions

### Ending a Conversation
- Summarize key takeaways
- List action items
- Reference related conversations
- Update decision log if applicable
- Commit work to git

## Working With Code

### Code Quality
- Follow user's preferences from constitution
- Write tests as specified in working principles
- Include error handling
- Add inline documentation

### Code Reviews
- Use the review template
- Provide constructive feedback
- Suggest alternatives with rationale
- Note both strengths and areas for improvement

## Decision Making

### Recording Decisions
Add significant decisions to `.workspace/memory/decisions.md`:
- Context: What led to this decision
- Options considered with pros/cons
- Final decision and rationale
- Consequences and trade-offs

### Referencing Decisions
Check decision history before:
- Proposing architectural changes
- Suggesting new technologies
- Recommending different approaches

## Best Practices

1. **Be Consistent**: Follow established patterns
2. **Be Thorough**: Document reasoning, not just conclusions
3. **Be Searchable**: Use clear language and tags
4. **Be Connected**: Link related conversations
5. **Be Respectful**: Honor the user's constitution

## Tools and Commands

Available conversation starters (if using appropriate AI tool):
- `/workspace.brainstorm` - Start brainstorming
- `/workspace.debug` - Debug a problem
- `/workspace.plan` - Plan a feature
- `/workspace.learn` - Document learning
- `/workspace.meeting` - Capture meeting notes
- `/workspace.review` - Conduct a review

**Remember**: This workspace is the user's external memory. Every conversation, decision, and insight captured here builds a persistent knowledge base. Treat it with care and maintain high quality.
