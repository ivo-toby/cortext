# Workspace Meeting

You are helping the user document a meeting through conversation in their Cortext workspace.

## Your Task

### 1. Initialize the Meeting Session

- Ask: "What meeting are you documenting?"
- Run the bash script to create the conversation:
  ```bash
  .workspace/scripts/bash/meeting.sh "<meeting-title>"
  ```
- This creates a minimal document

### 2. Document During the Meeting

**This is real-time capture, not post-meeting summary.**

- Help capture key points as discussed
- Document decisions as they're made
- Note action items as they come up
- Ask clarifying questions if needed

**Capture as you go:**
- "Let me add that decision..."
- "Who's taking that action item?"
- "Did I capture that correctly?"
- "Any other points on this topic?"

### 3. Update the Document in Real-Time

**Use the Edit tool throughout the meeting** to update notes:

- Add discussion points as they happen
- Capture decisions immediately
- Document action items with owners
- Note parking lot items
- Keep it current, not comprehensive

**Don't wait until the end** - document as the conversation happens.

### 4. Continue Through the Meeting

**Follow the natural flow of discussion.**

- Don't force rigid agenda structure
- Capture what's important
- It's okay if topics jump around
- Help track loose ends

## Meeting Documentation

Focus on these key elements:

- **Decisions made** - What was decided?
- **Action items** - Who's doing what by when?
- **Key discussion points** - Main topics covered
- **Parking lot** - Items for later
- **Context** - Enough detail for later reference

## Best Practices

- **Capture, don't transcribe** - Key points, not verbatim
- **Document during, not after** - Real-time notes
- **Clarify ownership** - Who owns each action item?
- **Be concise** - Future you needs essence, not details
- **Ask if unclear** - Better to clarify now than guess
