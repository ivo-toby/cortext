# 🧠 Cortext

**AI-Augmented Workspace for Knowledge Work**

Cortext is a git-backed, AI-assisted workspace that provides persistent memory, structured workflows, and searchable knowledge management for working alongside LLMs.

---

## ✨ Features

- **📝 Structured Conversations** - Templates for brainstorming, debugging, planning, learning, meetings, and reviews
- **🔄 Git-Based** - Every conversation and decision tracked in version control
- **🤖 Multi-AI Support** - Works with Claude Code, OpenCode, Gemini CLI, Cursor, and more
- **🧠 Persistent Memory** - Personal constitution defines your working style across all tools
- **🔍 RAG Search** - Semantic search across all conversations (coming in Phase 4)
- **🎯 Workflow Automation** - Bash scripts and slash commands for repeatable processes

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/ivo-toby/cortext.git
cd cortext

# Install with uv (recommended)
uv tool install .

# Or with pip
pip install -e .

# Verify installation
cortext check
```

### Initialize Your Workspace

```bash
# Interactive prompt - choose where to create workspace
cortext init

# Initialize in current directory
cortext init .

# Initialize in a specific path
cortext init ~/my-workspace

# Initialize with a simple name (creates ~/my-workspace)
cortext init my-workspace

# Navigate to your workspace
cd ~/my-workspace

# Customize your constitution
edit .workspace/memory/constitution.md

# Start using with your favorite AI tool

## 📖 Usage

### With Claude Code

Once your workspace is initialized, Claude Code will have access to conversation commands:

```
/workspace.brainstorm    Start an ideation session
/workspace.debug         Debug a problem systematically
/workspace.plan          Plan a feature or project
/workspace.learn         Document learning and take notes
/workspace.meeting       Capture meeting notes and actions
/workspace.review        Conduct code or design reviews
```

## 📚 Core Concepts

### Constitution System

Your constitution (`.workspace/memory/constitution.md`) defines:
- **Communication style** - How AI should interact with you
- **Working principles** - Your development methodology
- **Technical preferences** - Languages, tools, patterns
- **Guardrails** - Boundaries and constraints

All AI tools read this file to maintain consistent behavior.

### Conversation Types

Each conversation type has:
- Dedicated markdown template
- Bash script for automation
- Slash command for Claude Code
- Git branch for isolation
- Auto-commit on creation

Built-in types:
- **Brainstorm** - Free-form ideation
- **Debug** - Systematic troubleshooting
- **Plan** - Feature/project planning
- **Learn** - Learning documentation
- **Meeting** - Meeting notes with action items
- **Review** - Code/design reviews

### Git Workflow

```
main                          # Clean branch
├── conversation/001-brainstorm-feature
├── conversation/002-debug-auth
└── conversation/003-plan-redesign
```

Commits are structured and searchable:
```
[conversation] Initialize brainstorm: New Feature Ideas
[debug] Found root cause: race condition in auth handler
[decision] Chose PostgreSQL over MongoDB for scalability
```

## 🎯 Philosophy

Cortext is built on these principles:

1. **Local-First** - Your data stays on your machine
2. **Git as Database** - Version control for knowledge
3. **Tool Agnostic** - Works with any AI assistant
4. **Structured Yet Flexible** - Templates guide but don't constrain
5. **Privacy Preserving** - No data leaves your control
